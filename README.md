# My online resume 

This is the source code of my [online resume](https://vongkhmer.github.io/online_resume/).\


I built this using NodeJs, React and Bootstrap.\
I would like to thank OSS community for such cool libraries that I can use for free.

Please feel free to use my code, if you like.\

To learn about NodeJs, check out the [NodeJs documentation]("https://nodejs.org/en/").\
To learn about React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).\
To learn about Bootstrap, check out the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/).

## Disclaimer: 
I am not a front-end developer.\
I only learnt enough React to build my own site.

Have a nice day!
